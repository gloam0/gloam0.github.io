        Introduction: Ray Tracing vs. Path Tracing
    </div>

    <div class="mb-16" style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <div class="mb-4">
            Ray tracing and path tracing are very similar approaches to generating realistic renders by simulating the behavior of light rays as they bounce through a scene. Path tracing may be best considered as an extension of ray tracing which enables more comprehensive rendering techniques by introducing approximative statistical methods.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <strong>Ray tracing</strong> simulates the paths of individual light rays as they travel from the camera, towards pixels in the viewport, and into the scene. When a ray intersects an object, the color of the associated pixel is determined based on direct lighting, reflections and refractions, usually by casting secondary rays which are limited to a maximum number of bounces. Ray tracing intentionally simplifies the rendering equation by considering only a deterministically-chosen subset of possible light paths with a restricted number of bounces.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <strong>Path tracing</strong> extends the ray tracing model by attempting to solve the complete rendering equation with statistical sampling. Rather than using a set of deterministically-chosen light paths with bounded lengths, many randomly-chosen light paths are cast and their results are combined to approximate the integral term of the rendering equation using Monte Carlo integration (explained in greater detail below). This process allows for accurate and physically-based simulation of indirect lighting, also known as Global Illumination - lighting which results from light bouncing off multiple surfaces in a scene, and naturally captures effects such as color bleeding, soft shadows, and ambient occlusion.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <strong>The primary tradeoff</strong> is computational complexity. Where ray tracing's simplified model can often product satisfactory results with a single or few samples per pixel, path tracing requires <em>many</em> samples to reach convergence in its statistical approaches which allow it to solve the full rendering equation. Despite being more computationally complex, the physically-based nature of path tracing makes it particularly attractive for scenarios where true physical accuracy is needed, such as in the creation of photorealistic renders, or in scientific computing domains such as the simulation of thermal radiation, RF signal strength, acoustics, and more.

        The Rendering Equation
    </div>

    <div class="mb-16" style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <div class="mb-4">
            The Rendering Equation provides a unified mathematical framework for simulating the interaction of light as it interacts with surfaces in an environment. It states that the outgoing light at point $x$ in direction $\vec{\omega}_o$ is equal to the sum of emitted light at point $x$ in direction $\vec{\omega}_o$ and all reflected light at point $x$ in direction $\vec{\omega}_o$, where 'all reflected light' is the integration over all possible incoming light directions ($\vec{\omega}_i$) at point $x$ in the hemisphere $\Omega$ of the surface normal $n$ at point $x$.

            Practical Implications

            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>Integral Term</strong> - The integral over the hemisphere $\Omega$ is inherently high-dimensional, thus analytical solutions are impractical (and extremely computationally demanding).
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>BRDF Complexity</strong> - The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) $f_r(x, \vec{\omega}_o, \vec{\omega}_i)$ is material-specific and may involve a wide variety of material properties. It is the primary source of complexity in the integral term as it may vary significantly across different materials and throughout each step of a path.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>Recursion</strong> - Though not explicitly conveyed in this form, most practical applications of the Rendering Equation are recursive as incoming light $L_i$ is often the result of further integrations at each 'bounce' in the chain of intersections composing a path.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>Repetition</strong> - It may be obvious, but it's worth emphasizing that this equation relates the outgoing light at <em>one specific point</em>. I.e., a complete renderer may need to solve this equation millions or billions of times to construct a single frame or image ($\text{Number of Pixels} \cdot{} \text{Samples Per Pixel} \cdot{}  \text{Maximum Path Depth}$).

        Monte Carlo Integration (Importance Sampling)
    </div>

    <div class="mb-16" style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <div class="mb-8">
            Monte Carlo integration allows an integral to be approximated by repeated random sampling of the function being integrated. Importance sampling is a form of Monte Carlo integration that is useful when we want to generate samples in a non-uniform manner.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            That is, sampling is focused on regions that have a higher contribution to the integrel, thus giving a lower variance in estimation and allowing for a more accurate result in fewer samples. This means that even if the samples we choose have a low probability of being sampled under a uniform distribution, we ensure their contribution is accurately represented by multiplying by the inverse of the probability of the sample being selected from our PDF.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            The graph in the GIF at the top of this article seeks to demonstrate this. Suppose the function graphed is the one being integrated over and approximated with Monte Carlo integration. If we were to take uniform random samples, most samples would be in area with near-zero values. However, if we use a PDF whose shape matches the function graphed, the samples would be clustered around the most important regions (the peaks), and each sample would be scaled by the inverse of its probability of being drawn from the PDF to maintain unbiasedness.

            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>Sampling Variance</strong> - Any approximative measure introduces variance into the approximations it provides. Monte Carlo integration is no different, and high variance can result in noisy renders (manifesting as graininess, speckles, or 'fireflies' in the render) or slow convergence rates. The primary reason for using importance sampling is to reduce this variance.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>PDF Selection</strong> - The resulting effectiveness of applying importance sampling to Monte Carlo integration heavily relies on the appropriateness of the Probability Density Function (PDF) used for sampling. An appropriate PDF will closely match the magnitude of the integrand's distribution, thus giving the greatest likeliness for selection to samples in the greatest-magnitude regions of the integrand. Additionally, this implies that the shape of the integrand must be known prior to PDF selection. Finally, numerical stability issues should be considered given that samples with near-zero PDF values may result in a high variance of error when inversed, dependent upon precision.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>Numerical Stability</strong> - Dependent on precision, samples corresponding to near-zero PDF values may result in a high variance of error when inversed. It's common to introduce an epsilon value based on the precision of the numerical type used to prune such samples.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <strong>Suitability for Parallelism</strong> - Naturally, this is a much more suitable candidate for parallelization than the raw integral term. Each sample from the PDF in the hemisphere $\Omega$ can be computed in parallel, and the recursive evaluation of a path can occur completely independently from the evaluation of other paths. On the other hand, the necessary randomness of stochastic methods such as this can lead to varying computation times for different samples which introduces significant challenges for parallelism such as load balancing, thread divergence, synchronization overhead, and even coherency of random number generation.

            As a ray of light bounces from object to object in a scene, this chain of interactions is what contributes to the final pixel color. Each path is a sequence of ray-object intersections, with each bounce representing an instance of interaction with the material properties of the object it hit. Consider the path below, where $\mathbf{x}_0$ represents the camera's position (where the ray originates), and $\mathbf{x}_i$ represents the $i^{th}$ interaction with a surface.

                <strong>Exponential Growth of Path Complexity</strong> - The throughput $C(x_0 \rightarrow x_n)$ is a product of n terms, each corresponding to a path segment. For any non-trivial scene, the number of possible paths grows exponentially as $n$ increases - at any point $x_i$ which is not an endpoint, the continuation of the path through $x_{i+1}$ may be any member of the set of non-terminating intersection points (or, thinking back to the integral term of the Rendering Equation, the infinite set of non-terminating and terminating points over all directions in $\Omega$).

        Key Conclusions
    </div>

    <div class="mb-16" style="margin-left: 4em;">
        <div class="mb-8">
            <strong>The Rendering Equation provides a unified mathematical framework for simulating the interactions of light with surfaces in an environment.</strong>  Reflected light and direct emission are handled independently, where reflected light is considered from all directions in the hemisphere $\Omega$ of the normal $\vec{n}$ at intersection $x$. The $L_i$ term opens the door to recursion, as incoming reflected from direction $\omega_i$ is equivalent to evaluating $L_o$ in direction $\vec{\omega_i}$ towards the original $x$.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-8">
            <strong>Solving the Rendering Equation analytically is impractical</strong> due to the high-dimensional integral over the hemisphere of incoming light directions. Thus, numerical approximations must be used to make rendering feasible.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-8">
            <strong>Monte Carlo integration allows us to approximate the integral term of the Rendering Equation</strong>, especially when paired with importance sampling which allows us to focus sampling efforts on regions that contribute most significantly to the solution of the integral.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-8">
            <strong>PDF selection governs the effectiveness of importance sampling</strong>, as a well-chosen PDF (which matches the shape of the integrand's distribution) reduces variance and improves convergence rates.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-8">
            <strong>The evaluation of the throughput of a path is recursive.</strong> Each segment of a path relies on how the previous intersection scattered the outoing ray. This adds difficulty to parallelizing the evaluation of a single path as this is an inherently serial process, and adds complexity to parallelizing the evaluation of many paths as each path varies in computational demand and length.
